# Weather Dashboard

Weather Dashboard uses the openweathermap.org API to search for a city and return weather data for that city. Included in this data is the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index, as well as a 5-day forecast of the same info. Moment.js is used for dates and up to 8 cities are saved to have their weather easily refreshed.
